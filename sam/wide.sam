chapter:(#chapter.wide) Wide Structures

    The notion of separating content from formatting works quite well when the content is a string of words. A string of words has only one dimension: length. A printed string, of course, has two dimensions: length and height, since each letter had a height and a width. (Yes, in print the ink also had depth, but that is irrelevant for this purpose.) But the height and the width of letters is a pure {media-domain} concern. Fitting a one-dimensional string of characters into a two dimensional font on a two dimensional page is the job of the {rendering algorithm}. It is one of the first things that gets factored out as we begin to structure content.[*1] When we separate content from formatting, we separate the font from the character and are left with a string of characters whose length is measured not in inches but in character count.  
        
    footnote:(*1)
        There can, indeed, be some issues with rendering algorithms when it comes to hyphenation, widows and orphans, and the location of titles relative to the text, but with the appropriate {document domain} markup to delineate basic document structures, algorithms can handle these issues reasonably well. There are some fine points of typesetting aesthetics that may be difficult to automate, and algorithms can't edit the text itself to make a line break work better, as some human book designers will do, but that kind of manipulation is rarely needed. And if it is, you have the options of translating the content into the {media domain} and manipulating it by hand at that point. Of course, you won't do this for high-volume content that is delivered on a frequent schedule, but then you would not be able to do that kind of hand typesetting manipulation on that class of content anyway. Daily newspapers are not typeset with the same level of attention to aesthetic detail as hardcover books. 
    
    But when it comes to content that has two dimensions, things get more difficult. The main problem cases are:
    
    * tables
    * graphics and other media
    * preformatted text, such as program listings, that have meaningful line breaks
    
    section: Tables
    
        Tables are one of the more complex problems in structured writing, particularly in the document domain. A table laid out for presentation in one publication can easily get messed up when an algorithm tries to fit it into another, as this example from a commercially published book on my Kindle:
