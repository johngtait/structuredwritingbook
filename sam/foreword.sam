chapter: Introduction
    This is a book about structured writing. It proposes a theory of structured writing, by which I mean largely a breakdown of the ways in which it is useful for getting writing done. 
    
    I feel the need right of the bat to make a distinction between a theory of structured writing and a theory of markup design. Much has been written about markup design, but this book will have very little to say about it. Markup design theory largely concerns itself with the representation of the structure and/or meaning of texts. It intended use it to make the texts available for further use of study. It is concerned with whether and how markup truly reflects important aspects of the content of the text. In many ways, it treats the text as prior to the markup, so that the markup is a layer over the text.
    
    I see structured writing in an entirely different light. I see structured writing as an aid to writing. It is part of the process, as I describe in the opening chapter, of getting from ideas in a head to dots on a page. The end product, then, in not marked-up text. The end product is published formatted text for humans to read. 
    
    This does not mean that the people who are interested in markup design as a representation of the structure and meaning of a text are not interested in having authors write in that descriptive markup. Sometimes they are. But they don't design the markup for the convenience of support of those authors. 
    
    Nor is it to say that the outcome of structured writing process may not be a marked-up document of the sort that markup theorists want to have. It may well be. Structured writing should be about supporting any and every format that a customer desires. 
    
    But structured writing is about the authoring process. It is about managing and constraining authoring in such a way that the quality of the content is improved and (secondarily) that the process of creating it is more efficient. This will mean, in almost every case, that the format in which the content is authored is not the format in which it will be published, achieved, studied, or read. 
    
    Structured authoring assumes from the beginning that the authoring format is optimized for authoring, given the constraints necessary to produce the desired output formats. It assumes that there will always be a process of transformation between the inputs and the outputs.
