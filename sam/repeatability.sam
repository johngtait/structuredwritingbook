    Content is one of the hardest products to test. One of the biggest barriers to consistently producing quality content is being able to test that quality has actually been achieved -- that is, that the content is serving and/or influencing the reader as you want it to do. 
    
    The problem, has two parts. The first is that it is hard to observe the effect of content. You just aren't there to watch people read it. The second is that even when you do get to observe the effect of content on the reader, how do you know what aspects of the content achieved the created the effect you observed. Making these observations on individual pieces of content is of limited value. Yes, you can do continual A/B testing, taking down content that does not perform well and continually trying other things until you finally create a piece of content that performs well. But then how do you reproduce that success with the next piece of content you write. How do you determine which aspects of the successful content contributed to its success and should be emulated in future content? What you can't observe, you can't measure, and what you can't measure, you can't manage. What you can't repeat, you can't manage.
    
    It is not like measuring minivans or cans of peas, where every example is supposed to be exactly alike. Every piece of content is supposed to be different. It is great to find that you have a successful ad or blog post or manual topic, but to repeat that success, you have to look beyond the particularity of an individual item to see what it has in common with other successful items. Some part of the success of individual items doubtless lies in the features they and they alone possess, but much of it also comes from meeting specific user needs in a highly accessible ways, and there is often a pattern to that that can be repeated. For instance, there can be a pattern to a recipe that makes it particularly easy for a reader to choose which dish to prepare and to prepare it successfully, and those characteristics should be repeatable across a whole set of recipes.  

    The fact is that when you ask this question about a single piece of successful content your answer is little more than an educated guess. You are abstracting from a single data point. To be certain which aspects of the content are doing the most to achieve it aims, you need to observe multiple samples that exhibit the same basic features. It is when you observe that multiple pieces of content exhibiting the same features are all successful that you know with some degree of reliability that it is those features that make the content work. Once you know this, you are in a position to reliably produce new content that will be similarly successful. You have achieved repeatability. 
    
    To achieve repeatability, you need to partition those elements that you want repeated and constrain your authors to follow them. But is it is not enough to constrain content patterns after the fact, when you already know what works. If you don't have many examples of the same pattern to test, you can't draw any useful conclusions about which elements of the pattern are working and which are not. You not only have to constraint in order to repeat, you also have to constrain in order to measure. Without constraints, you don't know what you are measuring. 
    
    In order to generalize the measurements you are taking, so that you can draw conclusions that apply to more than one piece of content, you need to make sure that each piece of content you are measuring has the same structures and features. That is the only way you can measure if it is the structures and features, rather than the individual texts, that are performing well. You need consistent conformant content structures that express those features of a text that impact is quality. Until you have that, you have no reliable basis on which to extrapolate any measurements you do of individual pieces of content. 
    
    Once you have confirmed that these structures contribute to content quality, you need to insist on them in all the new content you create in order to ensure that it conforms to the constraints and structures you have established through testing. In order to achieve repeatability in content creation, therefore, you need structured writing. 
    
    The most fundamental part of content quality is to give the reader the information they need in a form they can use. A confounding aspect of content quality is that every reader is different. They are doing different thing, they have different experiences, and they have different vocabularies. 

    # ref to information architecture

    For many writers in corporate environments, lack of knowledge about the readers, their tasks, and their backgrounds, is one of the biggest problems in determining what content is required and what form it should take. While direct contact with the customer is undoubtedly the best way to address this, you can actually learn what content to create and how without every meeting the reader, as long as you can measure the performance of your content, generalize your results, and repeat the structures that perform best.   
    
    Organizations often look to content reuse as the principle source of cost savings in the content system. But as we have seen, content reuse can be quite expensive to implement. Cost savings are not guaranteed, and quality problem can result from an overzealous approach to reuse. Repeatability, which we can think of as the reuse of patterns rather than individual pieces of content can be a huge time-saver, and one that, if applied correctly, can bring big quality gains at the same time. And the kinds of constrained patterns which provide repeatability also direct the complexity of information design away from contributors, opening the way to greater {collaboration} by bringing in authors who are experts in the subject matter but not information design, and who do not have the time or inclination to use complex content management or reuse systems.
