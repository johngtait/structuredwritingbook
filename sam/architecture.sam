chapter: Algorithms: Information Architecture

    by: Mark Baker

    Information architecture is the arrangement of content so that it can be found and navigated. We have always had information architecture. The term is new, but not the need or the concept. In the past, though, information architecture was divided into two pieces. The basic unit of information was the book and the "architecture" of the book was an integral part of the responsibility of the author and editor. Larger sets of information were created by collecting and organizing books and that was the responsibility of the librarian or bookseller. (Libraries and book stores have different information architectures to serve different purposes.)
    
    With the advent of online media, first in the form of large capacity electronic media such as CD-ROMs and then the Internet and the Web, this division of architectural responsibilities was overthrown. The basic unit of information in electronic media is not the book but the page, and the relationships between pages in electronic media are potentially much more complex than on paper. Furthermore, the relationships expressed in a page can range across much a much wider field than those in a book. (Books can cite other books, but not provide an active link to them.) Also, the architecture of online media has to account for the ability to add, modify, and delete individual bits of content at any time. 

    This leads to the development of architectures of much smaller units with much more complex relationships to a much larger and more diverse set of resources. Additionally, the rate of change in these media is much faster, with pages being added and removed all the time. Finally, these architectures include not only text and static graphics but dynamic media: videos, animation, and dynamic feeds and information widgets. Given these factors, the old separation of roles between writer and librarian no longer works. 
    
    Authors have to be much more conscious of how their pages interact with other pages in the collection, including those created by others. The scale at which these small pieces of content relate with each other is much much greater than the scale at which the pieces of a book related to each other. This calls for a whole new approach to information architecture, and for the appearance of a function and a role that had no equivalent in the paper world. Thus the term information architecture was born, not to name something entirely new, but something transformed by our new technology.
    
    Information architecture as a discipline in its own right, as opposed to being an aspect of authorship or librarianship, has arisen to combat the chaos that emerged in many websites as they began to grow, lacking an overall organizing principle or influence. But we should recognize that information architecture is as much part of the book world as it is part of the web world, even if it was  not traditionally a job title in the book world. And if you are producing both web-like content and book like content, your information architecture has to comprehend both.
    
    Because information architecture involves the organization of large bodies of content it can benefit greatly from structured writing techniques. Any structured writing system need to have an architecture algorithm to implement the various aspects of content organization. 
    
    As we have seen, the first part of a structured writing algorithm is the creation of structures that support a function, and the second part is writing the code that implements the function based on those structures. What structures and algorithms support information architecture in structured writing?
    
    I'm going to start with making a basic distinction between two types of information architecture: top-down and bottom-up. Top down deals with navigational aids and organizing systems that stand apart from the content and point to it. A table of contents is a piece of top-down information architecture. Bottom-up deals with navigation and organization that exists within the content itself. A web site with a consistent approach to hypertext links within it pages is an example of a bottom-up information architecture.
    
    Bottom-up and top-down information architectures are not incompatible with each other. In fact almost every information architecture has both top-down and bottom-up elements. (Books, for instance, which are typically top-down, based on a table of contents, may also have internal cross references, which are a bottom up mechanism.)
