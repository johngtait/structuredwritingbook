    Content often needs to be translated into multiple languages. There are two ways to approach translation when you practice structured writing. One is to use your entire structured writing process to produce a finished first-language output, and then sent that output to a translation company to be translated. This has the benefit of simplicity, but in every other way is is unsatisfactory. The result is not {timely}(algorithm "timeliness"), and may involve translating the same material multiple times, even if the content has not changed between versions or different uses of the content. 
    
    In practice, therefore, it makes sense to translate your structured content at the source level and then apply all of your structured writing algorithms to the translated versions of the content to produce all your second-language versions. In other words, your translated content is structured content in the same way as the original content. 
    
    There are two main consequences of this. 
    
    All of the structured writing algorithms are available to govern and assist in the translation process. 
    
    Functional lucidity for translators is just as important, if not more important, than for authors. If translations are performed by people outside of your organization they probably don't spend all of their time working in your structured writing system, and the almost certainly don't know anything about the specifics of your content management practices. ...
    
    section: XLIFF
    
        There is a standard XML vocabulary for dealing with localization data. It is called XLIFF (XML Localisation Interchange File Format). It purpose is to improve functional lucidity for translators by hiding the complexities of source formats from them. A description of XLIFF, or how it might work with your structured writing system is beyond the scope of this book, but if translation is an important consideration for you, it would make sense to talk to someone with a background in localization as your design your system.
