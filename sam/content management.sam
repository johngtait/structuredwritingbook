chapter:(#chapter.content-management) Content Management

    <<<(annotations.sam)

    To many people, structured writing exists mainly as an aid to content management. In this book, I have taken a very different view, focusing on structured writing principally as an aid to content quality. Nonetheless, any content project of significant size requires some form of content management, and failure to manage content well will have a deleterious effect on content quality. So, any structured writing project has to take into account how the content it creates will be managed. 
    
    Content management principally deals with two problems. 
    
    * Orchestrating content for the publishing process. That is, making sure all the right bits get into the right documents at the right time. In many cases, there is a workflow aspect to this, making sure that every piece of content is seen, acted on, and or approved by every interested party in the organization prior to release. It may also include rights management issues, if there are different people with a financial stake in the content who may be entitled to compensation based on its use. These functions are well covered by other works, and I don't intend to discuss them in any detail here. 
    
    * Orchestrating content for writers during the writing process. For instance, if you are practicing content reuse, writers need to find content to reuse, and a content management system can help. Change management is also a huge part of content management: when a change happens in subject matter or in business requirements, how to you make sure all the necessary content changes are made, and made efficiently.
    
    section: Metadata is the foundation of management
    
        Content management system do their job largely through the collection and management of metadata. Metadata is the record of the identity and status of content. Management actions are actions on metadata: either creating and updating metadata or performing actions (running algorithms) based on metadata. 
        
        As we have seen, metadata is pervasive in structured writing. We defined structured writing as writing that not only obeys constraints, but also records the constraints that it follows. The record of those constraints is metadata. In fact, most of the metadata that a content management system manages is simply the record of the constraints that content obeys. This includes much of the metadata related to workflow, since the workflow requirements of a system are also constraints on the content.) 
        
        There is, therefore, a continuity between content management and structured wiring. Both collect and manage information about the constraints that a piece of content follows. And this means that the boundaries between structured writing systems and content management systems are fluid. Constraint metadata that is held in a CMS in one organization may be embedded in the content in another. 
        
        You might expect that the principle type of metadata contained in a CMS would be {management domain} metadata. After all, we described the management domain as an intrusion into the structured writing world, since it does not actually describe the structure of content. The reason for the intrusion of the management domain into content is to allow for the management of the content below the level of whatever file or chunk size you store in the CMS.[*XMLDatabase]
        
        footnote:(*XMLDatabase)
            In some CMSs, this distinction between the chunk stored in the CMS and the structures expressed inside that chunk is moot. A CMS based on a native XML database, for instance, makes no distinction between the chunk and the structure of the chunk, but treats the entire repository as a single XML resource that it can query and manage down to any level of granularity. Even with such a system, however, this distinction remain for the author, who had to deal with the structure of whatever sized chunk of content they are being asked to author. 
        
        But while you will rarely find much in the way of {media domain} or {document domain} metadata stored at the CMS level, CMS's often contain a great deal of {subject domain} metadata. 
        
        If you are managing a large volume of content, you will need some way to find content on a particular subject. If you are doing content reuse, for example, you will constantly be asking if content already exists on the subject you are preparing to write about. If your CMS is managing the delivery of content dynamically to the Web, it will need to respond to queries based on subject matter. And if you are optimizing your content for search you will need to provide the search engine with subject metadata in the form of keywords or microformats. All of this depends on subject domain metadata. Subject domain metadata is therefore central to CMS operations. 
        
    section: The location of metadata
        
        It is a very common pattern for a CMS to store document domain content and attach subject domain metadata to it. For instance, a CMS might store recipes written in MarkDown and attach separate metadata records to each recipe listing the key recipe metadata needed for retrieval and sorting of recipes. One of the things that writers often complain about with CMS systems is that they are not allowed to submit content to the system without filling out complicated metadata records. 
        
        An alternative approach would be to write recipes in a subject domain format in which all the recipe metadata is included in the content from the beginning. The CMS then requires no external metadata label, though it does obviously require a way to access and query the metadata embedded in the content. (CMSs based on XML databases often have this capability as a natural consequence of the XML database architecture.)
        
        Which approach is preferable? The conventional CMS approach arises because most CMS's are based on relational databases, which are good at storing metadata records and attaching them to blobs, but are not good at storing or querying the hierarchical structure of content. It has several disadvantages.
        
        1. It gives no support for subject-domain validation of the content. It does nothing to help improve content quality. By requiring document-domain content as the storage format, it precludes the use of the subject domain for authoring and cuts you off from all the advantages it provides. 
        
        2. The system has no way of telling if the content meets its constraints. It records the content constraints in a separate record without ever validating that the content meets them. 
        
        3. It separates the metadata from the content is describes. This allows for drift between the content and the metadata. 
        
        4. It can only record the characteristics of a chunk of content as a whole. It cannot look down into the content to find more fine grained metadata. One of the advantages of writing a recipe is the subject domain is that it allows you to do things like querying the collection of recipes for all those with a calorie count below 100. But unless the metadata record for the recipe includes that level of detail, the CMS cannot respond to that query. And if the CMS does store that level of detail, it is effectively asking the author to write the entire content twice, once in the document domain and once in the subject domain. Not only is this more work, it is quite likely that the two versions will fall out of sync with each other. 
        
        
        
        But storing metadata in the content presents some challenges as well. Having each piece of content stored in the subject domain makes a lot of sense from a semantic point and makes it easy to submit content, since not additional metadata forms have to be filled out. The problem is how to retrieve it. A CMS is essentially a database, and the way you retrieve information from a database is to write a query. A query is different from a search. A search is fuzzy. A search engine takes a plain text question of search phrase and tries to figure out which documents are the best match. Search engines may be powerful and sophisticated, but their results are essentially a sophisticated mechanical guess, and sometimes they get it wrong. Ask a search engine for a list of recipes with less than 100 calories, and it will give you a bunch of guesses based mostly on the plain text of those documents. Chances are it will catch some, miss others, and give you some false hits. 
        
        A query, on the other hand, is a precise request for items whose metadata precisely matches specified criteria. If you write a query to return recipes for which the value of the field recipe/nutrition/calories is less than 100, it will return all the results, miss none, and give you no false hits. However, it will work only for content that is stored that way. To write that query, you will need to know exactly how recipes are stored in the system. 
        
        If you have many different content structures in your repository, you will need to know how each of them is structured in order to create the queries to return them. This is not the end of the world. You can save writers from having to remember how to do all of the queries by creating saved queries that they can run at any time. But is is still a complicating factor. 
        
        To avoid this complexity, and make querying easier to do, some systems may provide a generic metadata label that is attached to all pieces of content in the repository. This will still contain subject domain metadata, but in a less precise format. This has two downsides. First, while it is easier to write queries, because you are always querying the same structure, it can be harder to make those queries return the right content because the subject domain metadata you are querying is not held in such precise containers. Secondly, it forces writers to record the subject domain metadata in a format that does not make it obvious or intuitive what metadata to include or how to express it. This means that the metadata records will be inconsistent, which means that queries will return inconsistent results. 
         
        In the end there is no way around this. Accurate reliable queries depend on precise consistent metadata. Precise consistent metadata is specific to the object it belongs to. There is no such thing as a generic metadata record. They are always specific to the things they describe. Subject domain metadata is specific to its subject. If you want to be able to find all recipes with calorie counts less than 100, you need recipe specific metadata that specifically records the number of calories in the recipe. If you want to find a used car listing for a blue convertible, you need metadata that specifically records the car color and body style. There is no generic metadata format that supports both these queries. 
        
        
    section: Managing the process    
        
        
        When we create an individual piece of content for one-time publication in a single media, there is really not much of a role for management in the process. Content management becomes a concern when you want to manage the production and publishing of many pieces of content, to manage the relationship between them, ensure consistency and quality, or to publish them many times in different ways.

        Of course, many of the reasons we have looked at for moving content from the media domain to the document domain or the subject domain have to do with managing the production and publishing process. But managing a body of content and the processes and tools that create and process that content, requires a whole set of metadata of its own. 

        Structured writing is about imposing constraints on content. Content management is about imposing constraints on the content process. But it is also about managing the constraints we impose on content. 

        Doing structured writing requires recording content in document domain or subject domain structures, factoring out invariants into separate files, expressing constraints, and creating algorithms to translate the content to the media domain for publishing. All of this creates a lot of artifacts to keep track of, and requires a process both for keeping track of them and for running the structured authoring and publishing tool chain. Thus there is a need to manage both the artifacts and the process.   

        Of course, all content is managed. Sometimes by organizing folders on your hard drive. Sometimes by using an elaborate content management system. But management is not part of the content itself. It is a process that exists around the content, that helps the content come into being. But it is not content. 
            
            
        This is not a book about content management. That would be a subject for a book in itself -- and there are several such books already. It is worth noting, however, that content management systems, particularly component content management systems, often use structured writing as a means to enable content management practices. This is absolutely a legitimate use of structured writing, though it is not one that I will focus on. 

        You should be aware, however, that some discussions of structured writing are based on the premise that it is being used to enable content management. In many cases, the driver for such systems is the content management methodology being used, rather than the writing process of individual pieces, which is the focus of this book. When you are looking at a particular structured writing system, particularly one tied to a content management system, it may be much easier to understand if you look at it as an enabler of content management functionality. 

        One prominent system that is widely used as an enabler of content management is DITA. This is not to say that DITA is only a content management enabler, but this is the motivation for a great deal of DITA adoption. 

        The fact that structured writing can be used both as a content management enabler and a means of improving content quality means you need to think carefully about what your goals are when you start a structured writing project. Are you looking strictly for quality improvement, strictly for content management improvements, or a mix of both? 

        If you are looking at both, or even if you are looking purely for content management improvements, it is important to understand that some of the techniques used to facilitate content management can have a negative effect on content quality. For instance, if you make your content more generic in order to make it more reusable, that has a negative effect on quality. If you practice extensive assemble-from-pieces reuse, this can compromise the narrative flow of the resulting narrative unit. Even though these things can be managed, managing them creates an overhead which not only costs money, it also divides the writer's attention, which can also reduce quality. Finally, the large scale use of management structures to enable content management seriously impacts the functional lucidity of your structured writing system, compromising quality and restricting your range of contributors.         

        As we have seen, it is possible to factor out a lot of management domain structures by moving content to the subject domain. This can help to maintain quality while making your management algorithms more reliable. There are limits to this, as this approach does not let you do ad hoc management operations, only those operations that are the logical consequence of subject domain markup. That may not necessarily be a bad thing, since any ad hoc structures in your content present a maintenance headache that may not be worth the management effects that they implement. Alternatively, you can use some management domain structures in your subject domain markup in order to support those management functions that you can neither factor our not live without.  
    
    section: Conflicting constraints
    
        As we have said all along, structured writing is about imposing constraints on content, and about recording the constraints applied to content so that algorithms can detect them. The first reason to impose constraints on content is to improve content quality. But as content collections grow, and as online content becomes more integrated, we also have a growing need to manage content, and to use algorithms to help manage content.
        
        For algorithms to manage content they need to know what constraints it meets, so structured writing is a natural place to turn when you want to implement content management. 
        
        But the constraints you use to implement content management may not be the same as those you implement to improve content quality. It is easier to manage content (or anything else) if it is more uniform. The constraints that you will naturally wish to impose to make content more manageable are those that make it more uniform. Thus a system like DITA which, as a starting point, proposes that there are just three types of content (concept, task, and reference) has an obvious appeal from a management point of view.
        
        The constraints that you impose to improve content quality, on the other hand, are those which make sure that a piece of content does just the job it is supposed to to. They are the kind of constraints that make sure that a recipe contains everything a recipe needs and is presented in the way a recipe should be presented. They are highly specific to the subject matter and to the audience. Three generic content types are not going to provide all the constraints we need to effectively manage content quality. Indeed, some of the constraints that are designed to facilitate content management may be positively damaging to content quality.
        
        We have something of the same issue with the publishing algorithm. To manage publishing effectively is to good to have a single highly constrained presentation file format (a pure document domain description of how the content should be presented). Such a format obviously does nothing to constrain how subject matter is expressed, so it does very little to address content quality issues beyond those related to consistent presentation and formatting. 
        
        But as we saw when we looked at the publishing algorithm, you don't need to write in the presentation file format. You can write content in the subject domain and translate it to the presentation file format as part of the publishing process. And if you are doing differential single sourcing, you may be translating it into two different presentation file formats for presentation in different media. (In fact, the desire to do differential single sourcing may be one of the motives for writing in the subject domain.)
        
        This works fine for the publishing algorithm. The algorithm gets the consistent presentation format it needs to work reliably and efficiently, but authors still write in the subject domain and thus have the benefit of subject domain constraints to manage content quality. The consistent document domain format is just a temporary artifact created as part of the publishing process. 
        
        But for the content management algorithm, this is no solution. The content management algorithm needs to manage the original source files in which the content is created. It does it no good to manage temporary artifacts created by the publishing process. If it is to manage the source files in a system where content is created in the subject domain, it is going to have to deal with many more source formats. 
        
        But while this may to be the approach you would naturally choose if you set out to create implement a content management system -- if improved content quality were not one of your business goals -- I would argue that managing subject domain content may actually lead to better content management in the long run.
        
        In any system that relies on constraints, on data that is known to meet certain constraints, it is necessary to make sure that the constraints are actually being met. This is the role of the {authoring algorithm}(algorithm) and the {conformance algorithm}(algorithm). And as we have seen it is often much easier to provide effective guidance and perform effective validation in the subject domain. Also, the subject domain allows you to factor out many constraints, which is the most effective way of making sure they are obeyed. The document domain provides far fewer opportunities for factoring out constraints and providing effective guidance and is much more difficult to audit correctly.
        
        Thus while a simple document domain system of concept, task, and reference topics meets the content management algorithm's desire for uniformity, it provides little opportunity for ensuring that the full range of constraints necessary to make content management and reuse work are actually followed. The result can be deterioration of the quality of the content set over time, a process that tends to be self perpetuating, as disorder in current content makes it harder to impose order on new content. (Just as you cannot put things away neatly in a messy drawer.)
        
        The variety of constraints and formats found in a subject-domain system may present a greater content management challenge initially, but it can go a very long way to ensuring that the necessary constraints are met. And, as we have seen, {you can often use subject domain structures to factor out management domain concerns}[#chapter.management-domain], which can go along way to removing the conflict between quality structures and management structures in content. This not only leads to more effective management, but also to a simple authoring experience.  
    
    section: Content management and reuse
    
        The {reuse algorithm} requires two things:
        
        * that you create content that will fit together with other content
        * that you be able to find reusable content when you need it. 
        
        Finding reusable content is a content management function. 
        
        Find reusable content requires answering the question: does this unit of content already exist? This is a complex question. It depends on what it required to definitively identify a piece of content as the canonical content unit for a particular purpose. 
        
        * Is it about the same subject?
        * Does it have the same scope?
        * Is it addressed to the same audience?
        * Does it meet my quality constraints?
        * Is it in a compatible form? 
        * Is it blackboxed across all uses? Could one instance change independent of the others. 
        
        It is also important to remember that answer to the question "does this unit of content already exist" will often be no. Every query costs time, and divides the writer's attention, but only those where the answer is yes save the organization any time or money. Thus the search for reusable content adds an overhead to the writing process even when there is no content to reuse. This can have two undesirable effects:
        
        1. It increases the cost of all authoring activities, which can create greater costs than any successful reuse is saving. It is quite easy for a reuse system to end up making an content organization less productive rather than more so.
        
        2. It creates a disincentive for authors to look for reusable content. This can result in content being duplicated. If this happens the duplicate content might itself be reused, resulting in your systems having the same content stored twice and each stored instance being reused in other content. This not only increases costs and makes searches more difficult, it creates a problem for the {change management algorithm} because it raises the possibility that only one of the instances will be changed when a change occurs, resulting in the change being missed in the other reuse chain. If enough inconsistencies like this accumulate, people can start to loose confidence in the whole system.
        
        You can greatly reduce the impact of this problem is you can give authors a clear idea of when they should expect to find reusable content and when they should not. 
        
    section: Creating manageable content

        We saw with the conformance algorithm that the key to conformance was to create structures that are easy to conform to. The content management algorithm relies heavily on the conformance algorithm. Successful management of content depends on knowing exactly what assets you are managing. The more you know about each asset, and the more reliable what you know about that asset is, the more confidently you can manage it, and the less likely the management system is to slowly descend into chaos. 

        What this means is that the content management algorithm depends on content that is written being easy to manage. It may seem like simple generic units of content would be the easiest to manage, but the problem with such generic units is that you know very little about them and what you do know is often unreliable. Generic units may be easy to create and easy to store, but they are not easy to manage. It may require more initial though and effort to plan for the management of highly specific well constrained content units, but such units will in fact prove to be the easiest to manage over time, especially as your content set grows.
