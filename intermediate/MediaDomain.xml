<p>The media domain is the <phrase><annotation type="concept" specifically="structured writing domains">structured writing domain</annotation></phrase> in which the structures relate to the media in which the content is displayed. Such content is often considered “unstructured”, but all content has structure, and we can actually find all the patterns and techniques of all forms of structured writing in the media domain. This makes it a good place to study the fundamentals of <phrase><annotation type="concept">structured writing</annotation></phrase>.</p>
<p>At its most basic, a hand guiding the pen over paper or chisel into stone is working in the media domain through direct physical interaction with the media.</p>
<insert item="../graphics/handwritten.jpg" type="image"/>
<p>The closest you can get to pen and paper in the computer world is to use a paint program to directly place dots on the screen. You can select the pen tool and use your mouse or a stylus to write your text. This will record the text as a matrix of dots.</p>
<insert item="../graphics/handwritten-bitmap.xml" type="image"/>
<p>There is very little structure here. We are recording a pattern of dots. Those patterns of dots are text characters only in the sense that the patterns are recognizable as characters to the human eye. The computer has no idea they are characters.</p>
<p>This is a pretty inefficient way to write. You can work faster if you use the paint program’s text tool.</p>
<insert item="../graphics/typed-bitmap.xml" type="image"/>
<p>This partitions the complexity of forming letter shapes from writing letters and directs it to an algorithm in the paint program (which does a better and more efficient job of it than the author does). However, those letters are still recorded as a set of dots, not as characters, so you can’t go back and edit your text as text, only as dots. The act of forming letter shapes has been partitioned off, but the partitioning in not maintained in how the content is recorded.</p>
<p>This failure to maintain the partitioning of complexity in how content is recorded is a problem you may encounter many times in structured writing. The ability to maintain the partitioning of complexity is one of the key features of a mature and reliable content system, and one that is often neglected in the name of using simpler tools.</p>
<p>To partition the complexity of forming and editing letter shapes completely, you need to move away from dots and start working in a program that records characters as characters. You could go to a text editor, but a text editor does not keep any formatting information (unless you create markup -- but that would be getting ahead of ourselves). That would not be partitioning the letter shape complexity, but dropping it. For most publishing purposes, plain text is inadequate. We need to maintain the ability to format the document.</p>
<p>One type of program that lets us record text as text and also lets us attach formatting to the text is a vector graphic program. A vector graphics (or “draw”) program creates graphics as a collection of  objects (“vector” meaning the mathematical representation of a shape or line). For example, it allows you to create a circle as a shape, described mathematically in computer memory, rather than as a set of dots. Rather than recording an actual circle, the program records an abstraction of a circle: the essential properties needed to reproduce an actual circle on a media, such as its center, diameter, and line weight. In other words, it partitions all the complexity of circle drawing into the circle object. The computer then lets you manipulate that abstraction as an object, only rendering it as actual dots when the graphic is displayed on screen or paper.</p>

</figure>
<p>In a typical vector graphics program, a shape is rendered into dots on screen instantly as you draw or edit the shape. Nonetheless, the computer is storing data describing the shape, not a circular pattern of dots, as it would in a paint program. This is an instance of what in structured writing is called “separating content from formatting”. The mathematical abstraction of a circle is the content; the dots that represent it on screen are the formatting, or rather, the result of applying formatting to the object.</p>
<p>By partitioning aspects of the content into a form that algorithms can work with, we can make it easier to create and manage the content. All the principles of structured writing are present in this basic piece of computer graphics. It illustrates that we have been using structured writing techniques for decades now. The question is not one of changing course, but of proceeding further along the course we have already been pursuing.</p>
<p>This is a pattern we will see as we look at structured writing across the <phrase><annotation type="concept" specifically="structured writing domains">three domains</annotation></phrase>. Rather than storing the image of the document to be printed, the computer stores an abstraction of the document which consists of raw text combined with (or, in some cases, replaced by) additional pieces of information which are commonly called metadata. This metadata can then be used to drive algorithms to convert it back into a concrete media domain representation that can be displayed to readers (and also to do a number of other useful thing that we will look at later).</p>

<title>Factoring out font information</title>
<p>Just as a vector graphics program represents a circle as a circle object, it represents text as a text object. A text object is a rectangular area that contains characters. It has numerous <phrase>media domain</phrase> properties, such as margins, background and foreground colors, the text string, and the font face, size, and weight used to display that text, as in this example from InkScape:</p>
<figure id="text-object">
<title>A vector graphics text object</title>
<insert item="../graphics/text-object.png" type="image"/>

</figure>
<p>A vector graphics program displays text in a chosen font. If you change the value of the text object’s font attribute, it will immediately redraw the text in the new font. The shapes of the individual letters in the font are required information for rendering the text object in the media domain. However, they are not stored as part of the text object. The representation of the text in the paint program includes the shape of the letters. In the vector graphics program it does not. That information has been factored out.</p>
<p>The shape of the characters (technically, “glyphs”) that make up the font are stored separately in font files. Font files consist of a set of shape objects that describe each glyph, together with metadata such as the name of the font and the name of each glyph. To actually display the text block on screen, the graphics program (or rather the graphics system API to which it delegates this task) combines information from the font file with information from the text object by matching the metadata to find the right font and character, and then drawing the appropriate glyph on the current media.</p>

</figure>
<p>The font file system represents a partitioning of the complexity of rendering formatted text that has been built into every modern operating system. By partitioning this complexity and transferring it to the operating system, the OS designers made it easier for every developer who wants their application to work with formatted text. Rather than programming text of font handling themselves, they simply call operating system APIs to do it for them. It also makes it much easier for anyone who wants to design fonts, since it partitions off the problems of installing fonts and making them available to applications. These two pieces of partitioning are a particularly powerful example of partitioning and transferring complexity because they mean that the sets of people all working in the content domain, whose work each impinges on the work of the others -- font-designers, tool-developers, and writers -- no longer have to know anything about how the other work and no longer need to communicate or coordinate in order to make their individual contributions to the overall content delivery process.</p>
<p>This is a pattern we will see over and over again in the partitioning of content complexity. In order to simplify the objects that we create to store our content, we take part of the information needed to do the final rendering, and move it to a separate file. By factoring out information that is constant for a given application (the shape of a capital D is the same for all capital D’s for text in a given font), we simplify the format of the information we are preparing and keep the downstream presentation more consistent.</p>
<p>We also partition the task of drawing letters in different shapes (typefaces) from the task of drawing the rest of the shapes in the graphic.</p>
<p>Whether it is, “the capital D will always be this shape” or “the list of ingredients will always have the ingredient name aligned left and the quantity aligned right”, filtering out these invariant rules into a separate file is a key part of structuring content to effect the partitioning of content creation complexity.</p>
<p>This means that designing a content structure, regardless of the domain you choose to work in, essentially consists of identifying the places in the content where we can separate out these invariant properties into separate structures: separating variants from invariants using metadata.</p>

<title>Partitioning the complexity of pagination</title>
<p>Writing a document in a vector graphics program is certainly better than in a paint program, but you quickly run into a problem if you try to write a document that needs more than one page. A vector graphics program works purely in the media domain, and pretty much lets you put shapes and text boxes anywhere you like. This certainly allows you to create a new page whenever you need one, simply by creating a new drawing. But what happens when you want to edit the text and need to change how it flows from one page to the next? Pagination is a complex process, and we need a way to partition that complexity from the writing task and distribute it elsewhere, preferably to an algorithm.</p>
<p>Word processors and desktop publishing programs effectively partition the pagination process from the writing process by introducing some document domain constraints, as well as some higher-level tools for managing large text flows. A document is made up of a series of pages that have margins and contain text flows. Text flows are made up of blocks (paragraphs, headings) inside of which text can flow, even from one page to the next. Common features like tables are supported as objects than can exist in text flows. New pages are created automatically as text expands. This leaves authors free to focus on writing and leave pagination to the program.</p>
<p>Pages, paragraphs, headings, and tables, are all <phrase><annotation type="concept">document domain</annotation></phrase> objects. Rather than working on a blank slate, as you do in a graphics program, you are now working within the <phrase><annotation type="concept">constraints</annotation></phrase> of these document domain objects.  These constraints remove or constrain decisions about positioning of elements, which makes creating documents faster and more consistent. Structured writing is about making content that obeys constraints, and these basic document domain constraints are the next step in that journey.</p>
<p>Partitioning off the pagination problem is not without its drawbacks, however. There are certain page layout effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in Word or FrameMaker because you have given up some of the liberty of a vector graphics program. We also gave up some liberty when we moved from raster to vector graphics, which is why photo editing, which requires adjusting individual pixels, is done in raster rather then vector format.</p>
<p>There is an important lesson here. We are starting to see that different partitioning of the content creation process is appropriate for different kinds of content. There is no one universal correct partitioning and distribution of content complexity that works for every type of content or every organization. This will continue to be the case as we look at more advanced forms of structured writing.</p>

<title>Partitioning the complexity of formatting</title>
<p>The intent of the desktop publishing movement was to combine the job of designer and writer into one, effectively moving the author from working in the document domain to working in the media domain, formatting content as it was written. As we noted, this was an attempt to repartition the publishing process to avoid the overhead of passing a publication from one hand to another. This was a net gain for some organizations, allowing them to spend less time and money getting content to the public.</p>
<p>But the inherent inefficiencies of the model, and the problems it caused by piling all the responsibilities of writing, design, and layout on the head of the author, were apparent from the beginning. In a sense, everything that has been done in the content management, publishing, and structured writing worlds since then has been about partitioning and distributing those responsibilities away from authors without returning us to the days of multiple time-consuming hand-offs between different trades to bring a publication to market.</p>
<p>One of the earliest attempts at such repartitioning was the introduction of stylesheets. Stylesheet mechanisms separate the media domain (formatting) elements of a document from the document domain elements such as paragraphs and tables.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>The limits of partitioning in the media domain</title>
<p>Using styles rather than direct formatting does not mean that you have moved from working in the media domain to working in the document domain. It just means that you have moved from working in an unstructured way in the media domain to working in a structured way in the media domain.</p>
<p>The set of document domain objects in a typical word processor is so small that it does not even distinguish between a heading and a list item. Both are just paragraphs with different styles applied. What distinguishes them is not what type of structure they are, but what styles are applied to them.</p>
<p>Relying on just a few document domain structures and distinguishing them with styles makes word processing simple, but it can lead to problems. Microsoft Word’s difficulties with maintaining list numbering are well documented, for instance. Because Word does not formally record lists as distinct structures, it can easily lose track of where they begin and end.</p>
<p>Word processing and desktop publishing tend to roughly straddle the boundary between the document and media domains, with authors thinking partially in document domain terms and partially in media domain terms, and the applications creating and storing structures from both domains.</p>
<p>While we can clearly divide the structured writing spectrum into the three domains, many actual writing tools and markup languages include structures from more than one domain. We will see this over and over again in this book. But next we will look at what it is like to work more squarely in the document domain.</p>
