<title>Metadata</title>
<p>We live in the age of metadata, so much so that the word metadata has almost come to replace the word data itself and has come to be applied to almost any form of data that describes a resource. For example, we hear a lot about law enforcement getting access to metadata related to phone calls, which simply means the data about which number called which number and for how long.</p>
<p>In the <phrase><citation type="nameref" value="chapter.definition">definition of structured writing</citation></phrase> I said that structured writing is writing that obeys constraints and that records the fact that it obeys constraints.</p>
<p>The standard definition of metadata is data that describes data. This can make it seem like an optional extra, as something added on top of something that already exists. But actually there is no data without metadata. Data is a formalization of information. It makes a set of promises about what the information means -- how it is constrained. Metadata is the record of those promises/constraints. Without it, you have no formal assurance that the information is what it seems to be.</p>
<p>Thus recipes contain lists of ingredients. If you record a recipe in the document domain, you will record that list of ingredients using a list structure. But this provides no formal assurance that the items in this list are actually ingredients. Human being recognize the list of ingredients for what it is based on familiarity with the pattern and recognition of the names of foodstuffs. This is fine for humans, but still a little iffy for our current generation of algorithms. Writing an algorithm to reliably recognize ingredients in recipe, while not impossible, is a lot of work.</p>
<p>Move that recipe into the subject domain, however, and you replace a list structure with an ingredients structure. The ingredients structure is a formal statement of what the data -- the ingredients -- actually are. It makes a promise about what the text inside an ingredient structure actually is. As such, it is metadata. Writing a reliable algorithm to recognize ingredients based on explicit metadata that says they are ingredients is simple.</p>
<p>This is not to say that a list structure is not metadata also. It is. It is document domain metadata. It formally identifies the list items structure as a list item. It makes it easy to write algorithms that recognize lists. This  allows you to reliably format it as a list item in whatever media you choose to publish it in.</p>
<p>Subject domain metadata that identifies an ingredient as an ingredient provide a different promise, one that allows us to do more with the data.</p>
<p>The purpose of attaching metadata to content is to make the content into data. The reason for making content into data is to make it accessible to algorithms. The best way to think about metadata is in terms of the algorithms it enables. Broadly, the areas in which we want to apply algorithms to content are publishing, finding, validating, and auditing.</p>
<p>Basic publishing algorithms can be performed using document domain metadata alone. But as we have seen, publishing related algorithms such as differential single sourcing, content reuse, and content generation also require subject domain metadata. Finding requires subject domain metadata because we search for content based largely on its subject matter. Validating, which deals with whether content meets its defined constraints, depends on the metadata of the domain in which the content is recorded. Auditing, which deals with whether content meets business requirements, generally requires subject-domain metadata as most business requirements are in the subject domain.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that all content get captured in the subject domain. There is another way to apply subject domain metadata to content besides recording the content in the subject domain. This is to apply subject domain metadata externally to the content or an an overlay to the document domain structures in which the content is recorded.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to have access to the data on which ingredients were mentioned in each recipe (perhaps as an aid to finding recipes), you could record the recipe itself in the document domain and then place it in a relational database table with a many-to-many relationship to a table that listed all know ingredients</p>
<!--  Example -->
<p>Systems designed primarily for document domain content creation, such as DITA, can include formalized structures for attaching subject domain metadata to document domain structures. In DITA, the primary such mechanism is the <phrase><annotation type="concept" specifically="DITA subject schema">subject schema</annotation></phrase>.</p>
<p>One of the primary contrasts between the document domain and the subject domain then is not that subject domain metadata is entirely missing from the document domain, but that in document domain systems, subject domain metadata is stored separately from the document domain markup, whereas in the subject domain it is integrated into the content itself.</p>
<p>This should not lead us to think that the two approaches are equivalent. They vary substantially in capability, implementation requirements and ease of use.</p>
<p>For example, when we talked about <phrase><annotation type="concept">differential single sourcing</annotation></phrase> we saw that subject domain content could be transformed into radically different document domain structures for publication in different media. (A table for paper vs. an interactive widget online, for instance.) Attaching subject domain metadata to a piece of content that contains a document domain structure (such as a table) does not give you the capability to differentially single source it to different structures for other media.</p>
<p>One area in which external subject-domain metadata excels is finding and filtering. You can certainly find and filter on subject domain content, but because there are many different subject domain structures, it can be non-trivial to figure out how to write the query expression that does the finding and filtering you require. By contrast, external subject domain metadata can be stored in normalized data structures that are consistent and therefore easier to write queries for. This consistency also allows tools and systems to put high-level interfaces over these query mechanisms for users that don’t know how to write queries themselves. As such, the approach is widely favored in content management systems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a limit to how fine grained a find and filter operation can be with external metadata. If you want the advantage of external metadata stored in normalized structures for ease of querying, it can only discriminate down to the level of the pieces of content it is applied to. It can retrieve that whole content unit, but not pieces of it.</p>
<p>For validation, it comes down to a matter of what constraints you want to validate against. As we have seen, moving content to the subject domain allows us to factor out many of the constraints that we want to apply to the document domain and to express and enforce the constraints we want to apply to how the content treats its subject matter. If content quality is your primary reason for adopting structured writing, these advantages are hard to ignore.</p>
<p>For auditing, the situation is much the same. If you are looking to audit the consistency of your publishing system, document domain metadata will suffice. If you are looking to audit your coverage of subject matter, external subject domain metadata attached to document domain content will give you a high level look at your coverage, but tell you little about quality or how well subjects are being covered.</p>
<p>When it comes to easy of use, there are things in favor of each approach. If you have standardized document structures and standardized metadata structures, then users only have to learn those structures.</p>
<p>On the other hand, separating subject metadata from the writing of the content itself means that writers have to do two separate jobs. Rather than creating the metadata as they write in the subject domain, they have to write in the document domain and then create separate subject domain metadata to describe the document they have just written. This create more work for the writer, and has frequently prove error prone.</p>
<p>This can significantly impact the quality of both the content and the metadata. Because the document domain does not impose any constraints on how a subject is treated, it it quite easy to apply subject domain metadata to content that simply does not merit it. If metadata is supposed to express a promise that certain constraints have been met, this creates a broken promise.</p>
<p>The fact is, promising that a constraint has been met without validating that it has actually been met is a recipe for broken promises. Attaching subject domain metadata externally to document domain structures always runs into this problem. No factoring our of enforcing of the subject-related constraints has been enforced. There has not even been effective subject-domain guidance provided to the writer while writing the content.</p>
<p>I noted above that external subject domain metadata excels in the area of finding because it makes it easy to write queries on standardized metadata structures. But there is a large caveat to this, which is data quality. It the promises the metadata makes are not kept by the content itself, the value and reliability of searches is severely diminished.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the value of any system is constrained by the quality of its data. Content management systems often fail or underperform because of poor quality data caused by a poor fit between content and its metadata. In particular, there is a tendency for data quality to decline over time. Systems based on this approach need to be aware of the problem and vigilant to prevent it.</p>
<p>We should also note that the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. The subject metadata used in both cases is essentially the same, since it describes the same subject. There is no reason, therefore, why you cannot take subject domain content, with its integrated metadata, and extract the metadata to an external metadata store. This way you can use the same query interface to find the content without giving up the validation and auditing capability of subject domain content or the finer-grained application of metadata that the subject domain enables. This approach can significantly approve the quality of the metadata in the system because all the subject domain guidance and constraints have been applied to the content before it is stored. Thus, as long as the content itself is correct, there cannot be a mismatch between what the metadata promises and what the content delivers.</p>
<p>There are ease of use advantages to his approach as well. Since the system metadata is extracted from the content metadata, the writer does not have to enter the metadata separately from the content after is is written.</p>
<p>Metadata is confusing because it is recursive. If metadata is the data to describes data, it is also the data that describes the metadata. The data/metadata distinction is not one of type -- metadata is not a different kind of thing from data -- it is one of relationship. It is a father/son distinction, not a cat/dog distinction. One man can be both a father and son. What we call him depends on what relationship we are looking at at a given moment.</p>
<p>In structured writing, we add structure to content to replace the things we have factored out. That structure is metadata to the data that is the text of the file. But if we store that file in any kind of repository, the information that identifies the file in that repository is metadata to the file as a whole. But that is not the only kind of metadata for that file. If the structure of the file is described by a schema, the schema is also metadata for the file.</p>
<p>Metadata is not a nice to have add on to data. There is no data without metadata. If Acme corporation does a survey that finds 9 out of 10 people rank Acme number one in their industry, the fact that this survey was conducted by the CEO at the company picnic the week before promotions are announced it the metadata that tells you what the data means. But we’re not done yet because the specification of the schema language it the metadata that tells you what the schema means.  And then of course, there is the specification of the markup to consider. The XML specification is part of the metadata for every XML document in existence. And we are still not be done, because the XML specification uses a formal grammar description language, called <phrase><annotation type="language">BNF</annotation></phrase> then the specification of that language is metadata for the schema language description. Check out this document which forms part of the chain of metadata supporting XML: <phrase><annotation type="link" specifically="https://www.w3.org/XML/1998/06/xmlspec-report-v21.htm#AEN56">Guide to the W3C XML Specification (“XMLspec”) DTD, Version 2.1</annotation></phrase>.</p>
<p>So, every piece of data has a spreading tree of metadata supporting it, which, if traced to its roots, inevitably leads to plain language documents that explain things in human terms.</p>
<p>One of the great questions about metadata is where it should live: with the data it describes or separate from it. For much metadata the answer is obvious. It lives separately because its scope is wider than one resource. An XML document does not include the XML spec. But for metadata that is unique to an individual resource, the question is an important one.</p>
<p>Most early graphic file formats only stored the image. Most modern format also store extensive metadata. Your digital camera files store all kinds of information about the camera and the settings that were used to take the shot, and even the geographic coordinates of where the shot was taken, if the camera has a GPS receiver.</p>
<p>In part the argument is about who is responsible for creating the metadata. In the case of the photo, the metadata is in the file because the camera is the best placed instrument to record it. Sometimes it is about whether the metadata is intrinsic or extrinsic to the content. Sometimes it is about control.</p>
<p>For example, should the history of a file be stored in the file or in the repository. Storing it in the file lessens the file’s dependence on the repository and makes it more portable. But a repository vendor may prefer to sell you a system in which to uninstall their repository would be to loose all your file history. If file status information is only stored in a workflow system, for instance, it is very hard to move away from that system. It it is stored in the file, it is easy to move away, and also to edit when not connected to the system, which can save you on licences.</p>
