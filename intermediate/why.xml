<p>Creating content is a complex business. You have to research your subject matter and your audience. You have to figure out what needs to be said and how to say it to achieve your desired effect. You then have to record the content, manage it, and publish it, potentially to many different audiences and many different media. If you are part of an organization that create a lot of content your have to coordinate what you are doing with what everyone else in doing and make sure it all serves the organizations goals. Each of these thing are complicated tasks in themselves and they become all the more complex when you have to coordinate them all. Not everyone has the skills or the knowledge to do all these things well, and if too much of the complexity falls on one person’s shoulders, it will limit their ability to perform well or deliver on time. In particular, writing is an activity that requires the whole of the writer’s attention. Any part of the complexity of the content creation process that impinges on the writer’s attention divides their attention and make it more difficult for them to write quality content.</p>
<p>You can’t reduce the fundamental complexity of content creation. All that stuff has to get done, and it is all difficult in one way or another. All you can do is to make sure that the inherent complexity is handled by the people or processes that are best equipped to deal with it. Managing a content creation process is all about distributing the complexity of content creation in the right way.</p>
<p>What happens if the inherent complexity of content creation is not managed properly? The complexity cannot be destroyed, so it has to go somewhere. If no one in the publishing organization handles it, it gets dumped on the reader. If a piece of content is missing information the reader needs, then the burden of finding the missing information falls on the reader. If the reader can’t understand the term used, or read the font chosen, or find content to explain an unfamiliar concept, or get the information they need when they need it, or tell current information from outdated, that is complexity distributed to the reader. Any part of the complexity of content creation that is not handled in the organization falls down to the reader, who must then handle it themselves or abandon the content.</p>
<p>Another name for this is poor quality content. Poor quality content is the direct result of the complexity of content creation being distributed to to reader instead of being handled in the organization. The way for an organization to consistently create quality content, therefore, is to make sure that the inherent complexity of content creation is directed to a competent and adequately resourced person or process in the organization itself.</p>
<p>Structured writing is one of the most powerful tools for redistributing the complexity of content creation to the right people or processes. A lot of this has to do with taking tasks that are being performed by people and having them performed by algorithms instead.</p>
<p>Most complex tasks have repeatable elements in them. A design question that has been settled once can be used over and over again without having to redo the design work. If one pieces of content is formatted one way, chances are many other pieces can be formatted the same way. Algorithms are great at doing the same task the same way over and over. Human are lousy at this.</p>
<p>Writing an algorithm to do a repetitive task redistributes complexity from the person who used to do the task the algorithm, but also to the person who writes and maintains the algorithm. For example, using a CSS stylesheet to format lists redistributes the task of designing list formatting from the writers, whose job is to know what they are talking about and how to say it, to a publications designer, whose job it is to know how to attractively format lists and how to code good CSS. Now the writer does not have to know about formatting or design, and the designer does not have to know about writing or the subject matter. By redistributing the complexity of formatting away from the writer, we simplify the writer’s life, allowing them to focus on their part of the complexity of content delivery, composition, and we distribute it towards someone better qualified to deal with that complexity, the designer.</p>
<p>The problem is, content, in its natural state, is not in a format that algorithms can work with. If we are going to redistribute some aspects of complexity from writers to algorithms, we have to get the content into a form that algorithms can read. This, of course, introduces new complexity into the writing process.</p>
<p>All tools introduce new complexity into the processes they serve. People have to design the tools and build the tool and learn to use the tool, and maintain the tool. All this is new complexity that did not exist before. We accept this new complexity into our processes because a good tool allows us to distribute our existing complexity more efficiently, so that less of the complexity falls on the people and more on the tools, and so that each person in the system only has to deal with the complexity that they are able to cope with.</p>
<p>Thus introducing CSS into your web publishing process increased the total complexity in the system. There is now a new language that someone has to learn, and possibly tools that go with that language. But introducing CSS allows you to better manage how complexity is handled in your organization by directing non-writing-related complexity away from writers and by directing design complexity to designers, who are better qualified to handle it.</p>
<p>Adding complexity to the system in order to distribute complexity better is pervasive today. The complexity of the technology stack that lets you send an email or a text message is staggering, but its directs the complexity of communicating over distance away from the users towards systems and the people who maintain them for a huge net gain in productivity. Structured writing will undoubtedly add complexity to your content creation stack, but if you use it correctly is will help you better manage the complexity of content creation, improving the efficiency of your process and the quality of your output.</p>
<p>This book is about how to use structured writing technique to distribute the complexity of content creation in the way that best suits your organization. As we will see, this is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. Different organizations have different kinds of complexity to deal with an need to distribute it in different ways to maximize the quality of the content they produce. This books will examine the principles of structured writing and show how specific structured writing techniques work to distribute specific kinds of complexity within the organization. Finding the right combination of techniques for your organization is up to you. Hopefully, though, this book will give your the information you need to figure out what will work best for you.</p>
