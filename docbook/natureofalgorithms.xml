<db:title>The nature of algorithms in each domain</db:title>

<db:para>By this point we have observed a great deal of commonality between the various structured writing algorithms and the way they are supported in each domain. It is worth it at this point to reflect on how algorithms are supported in each of the structured writing domain, as this can have help resolve questions about which structured domain it is the best choice for an organization to work in.</db:para>
<db:section>
<db:title>Media domain</db:title>
<db:para>In the media domain we are mostly dealing with the results of algorithms. If you work in the media domain, for the most part you will have executed the algorithms by hand. The only algorithm that is downstream from the media domain is the {rendering algorithm) which places final dots on paper or screen.</db:para>
<db:para>You may be able to do some basic content management of media domain content, however. It is also possible to do some basic composition with media domain content, such as wrapping a page frame around an article written in HTML. (HTML, as we have noted<db:olink targetptr="media-domain"/>, is formally a document domain language, but authors frequently use it in a media domain fashion, producing a result that cannot really be processed successfully as a document domain language.</db:para>

<db:title>Document and management domains</db:title>
<db:para>I will look at the document and management domain as a unit because the principle use of the management domain is to implement or support particular algorithms on document domain content.</db:para>
